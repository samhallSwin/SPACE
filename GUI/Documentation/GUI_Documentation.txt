Earth Texture:
For Development purposes Nasa “November, Blue Marble Next Generation w/ Topography and Bathymetry” was chosen as the earth texture specifically the 21600 x 10800 pixel version in PNG. Despite its larger file than JPEG it is a lossless form of compressing meaning the image will be clearer when blown up inside the program.
