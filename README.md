# Project I54 - Validating a new concept in Federated Learning for Satellite Swarms

This project requires the following Core Software Libraries:
* Python 3.12
* TensorFlow (Version: 2.16.1)
* TensorFlow Federated (Version 0.75.0)
* NumPy (Version 1.26.4)
* Pandas (Version 2.2.2)
* Matplotlib (Version 3.8.4)

## Project I54 Overview
**What does it do?**

The S.P.A.C.E project is a space simulation suite intending to validate a concept designed by the project’s client – Swinburne’s Space Instrumentation Engineering Group (SIEG). This concept aims to address current Earth Observation limitations, through the implementation of decentralised learning of satellite swarms, with the S.P.A.C.E project providing the framework for a virtual suite to which the client can use to further progress the initial FLOMPS (Federated Learning Over Moving Parameter Server) concept.
