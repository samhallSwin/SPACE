# FLOMPS Integration with Sam's Algorithm - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully integrated Sam's Create_synth_FLAM.py algorithm logic into the FLOMPS algorithm component while maintaining full compatibility with existing SatSim and FL components.

## âœ… Completed Integration

### 1. Algorithm Core Enhancement (`algorithm_core.py`)
- **Round-based Logic**: Implemented round tracking with target node selection
- **Training/Transmitting Phases**: Added phase cycles with configurable training time
- **Connection Evolution**: Integrated Sam's toggle logic with directional bias
- **BFS Reachability**: Added reachability checking for round completion
- **Parameter Configuration**: Added setters for toggle_chance, training_time, down_bias

### 2. Output Format Enhancement (`algorithm_output.py`)
- **Dual Output Support**: Maintains original FLAM.txt format + adds Sam's CSV format
- **Sam's CSV Format**: Exact format match with timestep/round/target/phase headers
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Ensures output directories exist
- **FL Core Compatibility**: CSV output saved to `/Users/ash/Desktop/SPACE_FLTeam/synth_FLAMs/`

Use this to create files
```
cd /Users/ash/Desktop/SPACE_FLTeam && python generate_flam_csv.py
```

### 3. Key Algorithm Features Implemented
- âœ… Round-based training cycles
- âœ… TRAINING phase (all connections zeroed)
- âœ… TRANSMITTING phase (evolved connections active)
- âœ… Target node selection per round
- âœ… BFS reachability checking for round completion
- âœ… Connection evolution with bias (down_bias for breaking vs forming)
- âœ… Load balancing preserved from original algorithm

### 4. Interface Compatibility Maintained
- âœ… All existing method signatures preserved
- âœ… SatSim integration unchanged
- âœ… FL core can read new CSV format
- âœ… Original FLAM.txt output still generated
- âœ… Configuration system compatibility maintained

## ðŸ”„ Algorithm Workflow

### Input Processing
1. **SatSim Data**: Receives adjacency matrices from satellite simulation
2. **Connection Evolution**: Applies Sam's toggle logic with bias to evolve connections
3. **Phase Management**: Alternates between TRAINING and TRANSMITTING phases

### Round Logic
1. **Target Selection**: Random satellite chosen as parameter server for each round
2. **Training Phase**: Connections zeroed for `training_time` timesteps
3. **Transmitting Phase**: Evolved connections active until all nodes reach target
4. **Round Completion**: BFS check determines when all nodes can reach target
5. **New Round**: New target selected, training phase restarts

### Output Generation
1. **Original Format**: FLAM.txt with timestamp/satellite/aggregator data
2. **Sam's Format**: CSV with timestep/round/target/phase headers and matrices
3. **FL Integration**: CSV format compatible with new FL core expectations

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

### Integration Tests
- âœ… Algorithm logic executes correctly
- âœ… Round transitions work properly
- âœ… Phase alternation functions as expected
- âœ… CSV format matches Sam's specification exactly
- âœ… FL core can read and parse new format
- âœ… Original functionality preserved

### Sample Output
```
Round 1 complete â€” all nodes can reach target 1.
Starting Round 2 | New Target Node: 2
Round 2 complete â€” all nodes can reach target 2.
Starting Round 3 | New Target Node: 0
```

### CSV Format Verification
```csv
Timestep: 1, Round: 1, Target Node: 1, Phase: TRAINING
0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0
...

Timestep: 4, Round: 1, Target Node: 1, Phase: TRANSMITTING
0,1,1,1,0
1,0,1,0,0
...
```

##  Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Algorithm**: Sam's sophisticated round-based logic with connection evolution
2. **SatSim Preserved**: No changes required to satellite simulation component
3. **FL Compatibility**: Output format works with new FL core requirements
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Original FLAM format still supported
5. **Configurable**: Algorithm parameters easily adjustable
6. **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive validation of integration



The integration is complete and ready for use in the FLOMPS workflow:
- SatSim â†’ Algorithm (Sam's Logic) â†’ FL Core
- Maintains all existing interfaces
- Adds enhanced capabilities
- Provides required CSV output format
- Fully tested and validated
